I applied, thinking "I'd never get it." <br>I got the job.</div>

          <div class="project-h2">Takeaways and Future</div>
          <div class="p4">My time spent here was very insightful and amazing to say the least. Although I never worked on the UX from end to end and just supported most of my time here, <strong>I got to experience many different things one after the other. I got to first hand see professional UX researchers and designers in the real world and how they tackle problems.</strong> I observed many usability tests, home visits, interviews, field research, and concept research that utilizes many of the standard and Sony-specific UX methods.<br><br>
            However, because I was supporting and observing most of the time, I did not always get to utilize the methods and activities. There is still more learning for me ahead because observing is only half the battle. <strong>Although, it was humbling being exposed to and seeing professionals in action which taught me all the best practices and approaches in the real life world and business setting.</strong> I realized that UX can still be limited by various factors such as business, politics, budget, and manpower.
            <br><br>Individually, I realized how incredibly detail oriented and assertive you have to be in the UX field. The importance of UX is necessary for the best products, software, etc. <strong>I learned that I had to step up more than what I usually do, as well as realize the need to be highly proactive within this field. You need to be able to anticipate, prepare, execute, and discover new things throughout the whole UX process and everything before, after, and in between.</strong> What I will be taking away from my experience at Sony is to go deeper and learn on my own accord about anything and everything UX. Simply observing is not enough, when real UX is when it must be done. I hope to find my future experience to be more stimulating in the sense that I will need to think for myself, find my own solutions and paths, and to be more involved in the end to end process.
