          <div class="project-h2">Small fry, big company.</div>
          <div class="p4">During the midterm season of my last year at UCSD, I anxiously applied for all entry level jobs and internships in the field of UX or anything remotely related to it. I had no luck and my anxiety was killing me not having any good experience. I saw an opening for "Human Factors Engineering / UI Design Intern". I didn't even know Human Factors was UX, I almost glossed over this job opening, especially since it was Sony. However upon reading through the job description, it was like the only thing that didn't requires years and years of UX experience. I applied, thinking "I'd never get it." <br>
            <br>
            Lo and behold, I received a call, another call, some silence, then another call. An interview. Got home from interview, received a call. I got the job.

          <div class="project-h2">My roles</div>
          <div class="p4">Some of the work you'd see me in the office doing would be: <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Intern</strong><br>
            - Taking notes of user actions, thoughts, and feedback during user tests in the usability lab<br>
            - Conduct expert user reviews and competitive analysis of products and software<br>
            - Support the GPL (Global Project Lead) and moderators in various logistics<br>

            - Recruiting participants for user tests and various other feedback sessions <br>
            - Helping check and correct user surveys for qualitative and quantitative research, as well as recruitment surveys for user tests<br><br>

            <strong>Contractor</strong><br>
            In addition to the activities above I also learned how to:<br>
            - Moderate usability, sound, OoBE and concept evaluation tests<br>
            - Create usability research and test plans, reports, and surveys<br>
            - Provide feedback for redesigning product materials, mobile app software, and hardware<br>

          <div class="project-h2">Projects & Experience</div>
          <div class="p4">Because I supported many of my team members, I was involved in a wide range of research and contributed my help in as much ways as I could. <strong>Much of the research and design conducted at Sony is highly confidential and is under NDA, I will only disclose limited resources at my discretion to hiring managers and recruiters who are considering me.<br><br>The information is highly confidential and will only be shared after the party signs my NDA disclosing that none of the information shown will be shared with anyone outside of the binding contract. Please contact me to obtain the work I've done at Sony.</strong><br><br> Below, I will mainly discuss the general processes, my exposure to UX, and my experience and thoughts. Feel free to look into a handful of projects I was involved in and my experiences below:</div>

          <div class="project-h2">Takeaways and Future</div>
          <div class="p4">My time spent here was very insightful and amazing to say the least. Although I never worked on the UX from end to end and just supported most of my time here, <strong>I got to experience many different things one after the other. I got to first hand see professional UX researchers and designers in the real world and how they tackle problems.</strong> I observed many usability tests, home visits, interviews, field research, and concept research that utilizes many of the standard and Sony-specific UX methods.<br><br>
            However, because I was supporting and observing most of the time, I did not always get to utilize the methods and activities. There is still more learning for me ahead because observing is only half the battle. <strong>Although, it was humbling being exposed to and seeing professionals in action which taught me all the best practices and approaches in the real life world and business setting.</strong> I realized that UX can still be limited by various factors such as business, politics, budget, and manpower.
            <br><br>Individually, I realized how incredibly detail oriented and assertive you have to be in the UX field. The importance of UX is necessary for the best products, software, etc. <strong>I learned that I had to step up more than what I usually do, as well as realize the need to be highly proactive within this field. You need to be able to anticipate, prepare, execute, and discover new things throughout the whole UX process and everything before, after, and in between.</strong> What I will be taking away from my experience at Sony is to go deeper and learn on my own accord about anything and everything UX. Simply observing is not enough, when real UX is when it must be done. I hope to find my future experience to be more stimulating in the sense that I will need to think for myself, find my own solutions and paths, and to be more involved in the end to end process.
