					<div class="text-div">This project was about improving an iterated design in the works before launching with the future of audio products. The app is a controller that allows one to install a new feature for a new music listening experience. Stakeholders wanted to see if they design changes improved the usability, understanding, and desire for the app and its new feature.</div></div>

What's wrong?</p><br>
<div class="textalignleft">
Can users discover and install the new feature in the app? Is the feature hidden? How will users rate and feel about the new experience? Will users understand and be successful in completing the setup process? Would users be interested in this feature?

	<p>
		Solutions?</p><br>
		<div class="textalignleft">
		What if we increase marketing and social media hype to advertise and offer this new feature and experience? What if we work with more partners to make the feature more appealing? We can improve process flow and ease of setup, as well as presenting the difference in experience, but discoverability will be up to its media presence.</div>
	


<strong>
Goals & Outcomes<br>
We would like to improve the application and setup flow to be more acceptable for the target customers. Additionally, we need to improve the instructions, text, and images, and the value of the new experience after setup. <br><br>

<strong>
Users & Audience<br>
The target users are those who are interested in quality, hi-res, and surround sound audio. Additionally, target users may also enjoy live music and studio quality experiences.<br><br>

<strong>Scope<br>
Stakeholders (project managers, engineers, and designers) provided prototype app for use. Because the app is a prototype there were known issues and sensitivities. Moderator may intervene to "wizard of oz" and tell the user their explicit goals. 1 week for in-lab testing, 8-10 tests required. Highly confidential and new software, we used internal employees who must not be involved in any audio marketing or engineering, and has not participated in previous tests.<br><br>

	<strong>
Process<br>
Define project scope and plan</strong><br>
Because this has been a design in progress for 2 iterations, the project scope did not change. The plan is to conduct multiple iterations of user testing to continue improving the app design and usability.

<br>
Define users<br>
Because this is a "niche" and new experience, stakeholders and UX team defined that music/audio and live music enthusiasts were the target audience. Working with the stakeholders, we conduct usability tests in our lab utilizing employees who aren't involved in audio. These employees must have an interest in quality music and audio, listen regularly, use streaming services, and own products over $100 (to differentiate from not-so-serious and the serious).<br><br>

<strong>
Recruitment and confirmation<br>
To find the users, we send out a local-based company wide email utilizing our research candidate database with a survey I created. Utilizing Qualtrics and following the criterias and exceptions made by stakeholders, I created a survey to ask questions and gauge potential participants music habits, services they use, products they own, etc while staying neutral and unbiased. After comparing with our proposed test session schedule, I contacted the potential participants who best fit the the requirements to participate. <br><br>

<strong>Research<br>
We conducted 10 usability tests in our lab, which features a 1 way mirror, and 5 camera system to ethnographically understand the participants thoughts and actions.<br><br>

<strong>
Usability Test<br>
We begin by asking about their products they own; to gauge why they like and dislike it, how much they paid and why, and how they researched it and bought it. Additionally, we also gauged their use of streaming services and their interest in hi res quality audio.<br><br>

<strong>
They are given a scenario where they purchased the test product and have the app, and must discover and install the new feature they had "heard" about. The participants are given the phone and product, with the phone at the main page of setup, and asked to go through setup as they usually would at home.<br>

<strong>
The moderator would time to time ask about their experiences and thoughts about certain aspects at certain "checkpoints" while the participants freely voice and interact with the product and app.<br><br>
