          <div class="p4">I was assigned to be involved in an OoBE test for a home audio product. Stakeholders wanted to understand how they could improve the product and its integration with a Voice Assistant product.

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">The approach</div>
          <div class="p4">Conduct an OoBE (Out of Box Experience) user test with participants specifically recruited based on target customer segment for the product. Participants opened and set up the product for the first time, and set up voice control. </div>

          <div class="project-h2">The process</div>
          <div class="p4">
            <strong>The problem and Stakeholder needs</strong><br>
            Stakeholders were interested in seeing if users can figure out how to install Alexa with the audio product just based off the setup guide which contains no explicit instructions for doing so. This is an on-going software implementation that we have been conducting user tests for a while.<br><br>
            <strong>Creating a user test</strong><br>
            My colleague created the test flow and script for this user test. We outsourced participant recruitment to a third party so that we have new eyes on this project. We set up a "living room style setting" in the usability testing room at the facility. <strong>The user test was created to be as hands-off as possible, to allow the participant to act naturally and go about their unboxing and setup as they would at home.</strong> Moderator would only intervene if participant truly has problems or time was running out.<br><br>
            <strong>Conduct and moderate the user test</strong><br>
            I moderated all test sessions for this research. It's much more interesting and eye opening when done in person. <strong>Usually I support logistics and take notes from behind the window, but moderating takes attentiveness to detail, skilled note taking, willingness to discover, active listening, and careful speaking skills.</strong> I learned how to talk to users / participants carefully, especially not to introduce bias. I also learned what, when, and how to ask questions to probe participants about their thought process. In addition, it was very good practice to identify issues and user actions.<br><br>
            <strong>Creating the usability report</strong><br>
            In addition to moderating the user test, I also created the usability test report. I detailed and ranked all issues found from the test on an A-D scale (A = major issue, D = minor issue may not affect usability). I created a setup flow that details what and where users most often failed, providing an overview of where in the process stakeholders can improve the design on. Because the setup flow includes a physical setup and software setup, I detailed every step and provided reasons of why users were failing. This also included the importance of needing to solve the issue, as well as providing design recommendations to improve the design and flow of the setup.

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Findings</div>
          <div class="p4"> I was thoroughly surprised that the participants enjoyed the concept and ability to use voice control with the audio product, despite having many issues and roadblocks during their experience. Many had difficulty with certain visuals and steps in the setup guide but felt it was their error for not reading and following directions. The lack of clarity in the instructions ultimately determined if the participant was successful or not, due to the rest of the setup and voice control depends entirely if the product was initially set up correctly. I had to guide and help many of them through the setup process. The largest concern was that the design and setup flow does not tell them how they could set up voice control. I understood their perspective as a customer would not know a feature if the design or instructions never mentions it. This finding was very crucial for me to recommend this as a design flaw which may very well make or break the feature and sales of the product.

          <div class="project-h2">Conclusions and Experience</div>
          <div class="p4">Moderating this user test was one of the best experiences I've had in my time here because it really put me in the driver seat and took all the practice and knowledge I obtained from observing and studying my colleagues in action. I learned to "cheat" by using what works and doesn't work from what I've experienced as a support and observer. I had to use all my UX senses to drive the user test forward while catching all the users actions, thoughts, and nuances. <strong>I learned how to pay attention to detail, balance tasks, engage with users in an unbiased approach, and absorb everything a user does that can potentially be used to improve the user experience. It's also very important to know the in's and out's of the thing you're testing.</strong> There may be things that a user discovers, but as with anything, problems can arise which maybe impact the data and findings. Moderating is fun!</div>
