          <div class="p4">
            <strong>Research</strong><br>
            This was my first time using a product that was aimed for the older age group and those with disabilities. The product is only available in Japan, and the stakeholders were curious if the product is easy to setup from a users perspective. Additionally, they were interested if this kind of product would do in the US market. Because there was not many products specially designed for this target user, no research was conducted. However, based on my prior experience conducting interviews, home visits, and inquiries with disabilities such as blindness, I tried to keep the perspective of the user and their family members (because most have family, friends, or professionals assist them in their daily lives) to see if the product makes sense and is easy to setup and use.<br><br>
            <strong>Planning</strong><br>
            Because the request did not require any actual user testing, I conducted a usability review from unboxing to actual use. We call this an "expert review" because we as UX researchers go through the process to find each and every usability issue and report them. My process when conducting an expert review includes:
            - Not researching or watching unboxing / reviews on YouTube because that may bias me as a new user
            - Taking photos of every detail and step of the unboxing process
            - Inspecting the box and package design
            - Opening the product 
            - Capturing notes of every detail each step of the way
            - Initial setup following provided setup guide
            - First use and checking all features
            - Testing in various possible use case scenarios<br><br>
            <strong>Process</strong><br><br>
            Since this product was not available in the US, I had no way to research and understand the design beforehand. I was essentially a new user without any bias. I began the process by opening the product and taking photos along the way. Nothing about the unboxing process stuck out to me as a difficulty or roadblock, and I believed there would be no difficulty with those who are not tech saavy. It was a very straight forward unboxing and package design. During the setup of the product, I read through and followed the steps of the setup guide. It was fairly simple and easy to understand, but the sections that included more of the tech seemed like it could be a little difficult, because it required making some connections that a non tech-saavy person may have trouble with. Additionally,

          <div class="project-h2">Findings</div>
          <div class="p4"> A lot of abilities I want are not yet possible.
          Many of the daily activities we do are much more complicated than it seems. Configuring many processes and devices to do what I exactly want is unlikely, because there are a lot of software and hardware limitations.<br>

          There are also limitations on how devices interact with each other.<br>


          It is an always learning process.
          Even with the amount of prior research done before buying and using the products, I learned more about them and smart home environments work in real time. <br>

          The learning process went both ways; encountering barriers and opening doors along the way of configuring a fully compatible and voice controllable room.<br>


          From start to end, things should be easier.
          These smart home products began to be more “dumb” than smart after using them. Setting them up and using them requires a lot of time before even using them. They’re only as smart as you make them, and when issues arise, they’re difficult to troubleshoot. Often times it isn’t issues with the user or configuration, but the product itself for unknown reasons. <br>

          For example, having to restart or re-setup the product for features or connection to work better. Most times I found myself blindly searching the internet for anything related to my issues. Troubleshooting is not always straightforward with smart home products, especially since every environment is different.<br>

          There is a lot of room for improvement. Ideally making set up across products more streamlined and easier to connect.
          I found most annoyance with how I had to always unlink and relink the accounts and sync every time. That’s too tedious to do, especially when troubleshooting and figuring out why some voice commands aren’t working as they should.
          Another issue is with the lack of full customization with certain products.
          Smart home products are becoming an off-the-shelf DIY way of home automation. It’s important that the user shouldn’t be confused and feel lost when setting up their products.

          <div class="project-h2">Conclusions and Experience</div>
          <div class="p4">The overall experience was rewarding and humbling.
          I had zero experience with smart home products as well as setting up home audio entertainment. I learned a lot about what it takes to set them up, troubleshooting and how it affects daily life.
          I had a real experience of the full process that most customers and users go through in the real world.
          Understanding the successes and pitfalls of building a smart room with most smart home products and common entertainment devices, helps identify where users may struggle when using these products.
          Additionally, hopefully this experience is useful for not only the UX team with learning more about user experience in the living space, but product planners and administration who can become inspired to innovate and change daily life in the homes of customers.</div>
