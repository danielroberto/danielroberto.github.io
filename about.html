	<div class="p4">Hiya there! My name is Daniel and I'm currently a contract Human Factors Engineer at Sony Electronics in San Diego! <br><br> In my college years, I studied Cognitive Science; specializing in Human-Computer Interaction at University of California, San Diego. I'm an aspiring UX Designer / Engineer / Researcher (it's often hard to choose what I'm exactly interested in!), as well as an aspiring professional photographer and graphic designer. <br><br> The best thing I love about UX is that it is just one big, long project. Coming from a project-based high school, I learned how to collaborate with my peers and work toward a certain goal by taking each step at a time. It really feels great when parts of the puzzle start to come together toward a final product, and how creativity and collaboration play a large role in the making of it. I hope to create and improve anything I can for the benefit of the world and its communities, to feel the same sense of enjoyment when interacting with something I enjoyed working on. <br><br> Let's work together! :)</div>
