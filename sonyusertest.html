          <div class="project-h2">The process</div>
          <div class="p4">
            <strong>Research</strong><br>
            There has been much research and development for this feature / format. <strong>However, what we aimed to do is continue gather user feedback after each iteration of the mobile app.</strong> This is to keep improving the app and concept in hopes of creating a polished product and gather more customers for this new audio concept. I have supported this project through 3 iterations.<br><br>
            <strong>Planning</strong><br>
            <strong>The plan is to have different participants each iteration so that there are new eyes on the app, design, and concept.</strong> We specifically recruit people who have not been previously involved, or involved in any sort of audio engineering and marketing. We also recruit for people who are likely to be target users. We provide a phone and headphones for them to go through the setup process with the moderator.<br><br>
            <strong>Setup</strong><br>
            Testing is conducted in our usability lab, and the participant and moderator are seated. They are given the phone and headphones and instructed what their goal of the session is, as well as reminding them to do what they would do naturally and give us feedback.

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Findings</div>
          <div class="p4"> Speaking from the most recent iteration, the setup flow and feature was regarded positively by participants. They found it fairly easy to go through, minimal confusion, and the flow didn't take as long as the first test we conducted. During the first iterations of the app, the app received majority negative feedback and many participants were left confused, lost, and stuck throughout the process. In addition, most could not confidently say they would use or want the feature without being able to try it out with their own music they are familiar with, and the pricing of the feature was also a concern. <strong>With the recent test, we found most people did not have as many issues with the app, moreso with if the audio concept fits their lifestyle and ability to justify the price for the service.</strong>

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Conclusions and Experience</div>
          <div class="p4">Because I've supported through 3 iterations of this app, and have stayed involved in the planning and recommendations provided by my colleagues, it was great to see the improvement each iteration to the point where it is at right now. We received fairly positive feedback this time, the rest is up to more UX improvement, marketing, and business relations.</div>


          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Takeaways and Future</div>
          <div class="p4">This project is one of the biggest examples of the UX process I've seen, especially in terms of iteration. The app prototype was created before the actual concept was created. The stakeholders wanted to see how users could find and activate the feature, as well as understand the interest in such a feature. It started out as a high fidelity prototype with a little bit of Wizard of Oz, and now an almost fully integrated app feature and connection with a 3rd party streaming app. There's a lot of ways you can find solutions, however they're easier said than done, especially dealing with business and politics. <strong>A lot of UX issues we encountered were mainly due to marketing and business relations that lent to some negative feedback and roadblocks. I think the biggest takeaway is framing UX issues and feedback found in tests in ways that are also issues with business relations and marketing to show that fixing them will lead to success of a product. </strong>
