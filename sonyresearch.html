          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Context</div>
          <div class="p4">I was assigned to support research for creating personas for a new target customer segment.
          </div>



          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>

          <div class="project-h2">The problem</div>
          <div class="p4"><br>What can we find about this target customer segment and what products can we create and align for their needs and wants?<br>

    </div>


          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">The approach</div>
          <div class="p4">Conduct user research to discover personas, trends, and interests in new audio concepts. We traveled to each participants homes to conduct in-person interviews and inquiries into their daily music listening lives and environment.</div>

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">My role</div>
          <div class="p4">Note taker, technical support, photo/videographer.</div>

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">The process</div>
          <div class="p4">We created a survey to find those who fit the target user based off the stakeholders customer criteria. From there, the stakeholders decided which fit the criteria best and wanted to visit and interview. <strong>We traveled around San Diego to the participants homes to ask them a list of questions, asking them about their various habits, interests, products, and events they attend.</strong> From there, we compile all the notes and findings from each interview to classify them under certain groups. We then create personas and compare them across the other users we found, to discover and create trends, similarities, and determining who from the interviewees would be our target users.
            
          </div>

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Findings</div>
          <div class="p4">We found some interesting things about the people and families we interviewed. Many fit the target criteria in some ways but still wouldn't fit the criteria due to lifestyle and cost. While others really fit the target criteria and they would be the ones who would be our customers. We found where each participant fell on a scale for determining the target users. We also found trends that participants all did and did not do, as well as the diversity of how they approach music, their products, and how music fits in their lifestyles. <strong>Although the target user is a bit niche, it was surprising to find participants who accurately fit what stakeholders were looking for. Their feedback, habits, and interests proved to be insightful for product planners in Tokyo.</strong>
            
          </div>

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Conclusions and Experience</div>
          <div class="p4">It was an interesting experience to learn more about people and their environments. A lot of hidden trends and habits emerged just from interviewing them, having them give us a tour of their home, showing us how they use their products, and a run down of their daily lives. We were able to infer a lot of information just based off of our observations and interviews. <strong>Being able to create personas from our interviews and classifying who and what falls under each felt like putting pieces of a puzzle together, for stakeholders to better understand their customers better than just looking at data.</strong></div>

         

          <div class="project-spacer-small"></div>
          <div class="project-h2">Takeaways and Future</div>
          <div class="p4">Because this type of research is more to understand users and identify any opportunities, I had a closer look at how we can find problems and create personas based off people we interviewed and extrapolate them to a wider audience. <strong>I had first hand experience being in the environments of the users / customers and it really helped understand who, what, why, where, and how they are with products in their daily lives. I also had first hand experience with my colleagues and stakeholders to organize our data, create affinity diagrams, and personas.</strong> I believe this kind of experience is highly useful and would frame my thinking and prepare me for future user research.
